## taoTestGeneration
taoTestGeneration is a [TAOâ“‡](www.taotesting.com) custom module developed in the context of the [EAGLE FP7 project](http://www.eagle-learning.eu/en/project/objectives). It provides automatic test generation facilities by using the taoAigFacade to address a server for automatic item generation. It then composes a test from those resources.
