# Heartcode CanvasLoader
Heartcode CanvasLoader is a JavaScript UI library, which uses the HTML canvas element to draw and animate circular preloaders.<br/>
The library is currently in beta, some minor changes and improvements might be done to it in the near future.

##Tools
I created a tool that can help with generating and previewing loaders with copy/paste code snippets and instructions: http://heartcode.robertpataki.com/canvasloader

##Documentation
The latest documentation can be found here: http://heartcode.robertpataki.com/canvasloader/docs/CanvasLoader.html

## Contribution
Please contribute :) I am quite new to JavaScript and I am pretty sure that there are million ways of making the library better, cleaner and smaller. Any constructive contribution is welcome and appriciated.

You can also add your website / web app link to the Wiki, so the community can see how others use CanvasLoader.
